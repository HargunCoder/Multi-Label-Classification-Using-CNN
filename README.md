# Multi-Label-Classification-Using-CNN
A solution to internet abuse using CNN and FastText

## Abstract Of Project
Social networking and online conversation platforms provide us the power and ease to share our
views as well as ideas. However, we are facing situations where, most of the people have taken these platforms as
take for granted where they see it as an opportunity to harass and target others leading to cyber-attack and cyberbullying, nightmare experiences and suicidal attempts in extreme cases. Manually identifying and classifying
such comments is a very long, tiresome and unreliable process. In order to solve this challenge, we are aiming to
develop a deep learning system which will identify such negative content over online discussion sections and
successively classify them into proper labels. Our proposed model aims to apply the text-based convolution
Neural Network (CNN) with word embedding, using Fast Text Method to analyze the comments. Fast-Text has
shown more efficient results than Word2Vec and GLOVE model. Our model will aim to improve detecting
different types of toxicity to improve the social media experience. The dataset used for building the model is
Wikipediaâ€™s talk page edits.
