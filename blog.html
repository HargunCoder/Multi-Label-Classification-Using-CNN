	<h2>Chatbots-Our Chatty Friends</h2>
	<p class="quote">Have you had an experience talking with a chatbot while looking for help or customer care? Or a chatbot assistant like Google Assistant or Siri has become your irreplaceable companion who manages almost all your actions throughout the day? Or simply you just have fun talking to a chatbot like Ruuh?</p>

	<p>Whichever be the case you might choose,it shows that you have already experienced the power of a chatbot. It has made a big place for itself, in customer care,entertainment etc industries and continues to grow. So wouldn't you like to know more about chatting friends?</p>

	<p>A chatbot has many names like talkbot, chatterbot, Bot, chatterbox, Artificial Conversational Entity (lots of names). In simple words a chatbot can be described as a computer program that talks with user as its a real person.</p>

	<p>In industry, chatbot is defined as a computer program which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test.(a test of a machine's ability to show intelligence equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human,to pass the Turing test)</p>
